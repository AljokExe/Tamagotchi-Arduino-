# Tamagotchi-Arduino
Tamagotchi is an authentic emulator of the Tamagotchi P1, designed to run on Arduino UNO hardware. This emulation framework is built upon TamaLib and has undergone significant optimization efforts to ensure compatibility with the limited resources of the Arduino UNO, which includes only 32K Flash memory and 2K of RAM.
